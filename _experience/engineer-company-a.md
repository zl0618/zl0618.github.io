excerpt: As an AI Development Intern at Alpha Business Compliance Limited, I developed and implemented AI solutions, focusing on the agricultural sector. I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to build an AI farming agent using Langfow (LLM) for communication and a deep learning model (1D CNN, LSTM) to analyze time-dependent data, correlating harvest dates with environmental factors.
