In this project, I have constructed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by 1. just using Python with NumPy and Pandas; 2. PyTorch; 3. Tensorflow. This project has given me a deeper understanding of how neural networks work behind the codes in a more "mathematical approach". For a more comprehensive description of how I worked it out, please check out my blog on Medium, which can be found in the navigation tab "Blog" above.
