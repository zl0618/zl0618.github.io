A model that could predict the harvest date based on 3 main factors: air temperature, humidity and luminosity on how they could affect the growth rate of these lettuces, thus the growth rate.

For more details on how I built this model, check out my blog: https://medium.com/@zoelam1215_35712/how-did-i-start-my-first-machine-learning-project-b05c6c31bc57, or the GitHub repository for it: https://github.com/zl0618/Harvest_Date_Prediction.git
